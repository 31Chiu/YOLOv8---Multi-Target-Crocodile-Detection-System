# YOLOv8---Multi-Target-Crocodile-Detection-System
The Multi-Target Crocodile Detection System (MTCDS) project offers a clever surveillance system that can identify and monitor multiple crocodiles simultaneously. For the project purposes are increasing detection accuracy, supporting target identity over time, and increasing tracking stability, it integrates AI-driven approaches.
